# UNOCHA SVG Icons
### Produced for use at the British Red Cross

**Purpose**
 * UN created a standard set of humanitarian icons for us in humanitarian information products
 * Icons were created in PDF and Adobe Illustrator format
 * However, use of icons in SVG format for online products was previously difficult
 * Created these SVG icons and hosted them publically here on Github so that my team (and others) can use them for online information management products
